# LEAVES
Light curve dataset

Based on the open datasets of ASAS-SN, Gaia and ZTF, we construct a compatible light curve dataset named LEAVES for automated recognition of variable stars, from the work " LEAVES: An Expandable Light Curve Dataset for Automatic Classification of Variable Stars ". The dataset contains a total of 979,962 variable and 134,592 non-variable light curves, in which the supported variables are divided into 6 superclasses and 9 subclasses. We validate the compatibility of the data set through experiments and use it to train a hierarchical random forest classifier. Here we provide the light curves of these objects by class in csv files. The full data set and machine learning models are also available and will be released officially at the China National Astronomical Data Center.
